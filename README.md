### The "push_swap" project at 42 challenges participants to create an efficient sorting algorithm for a set of integers using two stacks. This project explores algorithmic design, optimization, and the manipulation of data structures, providing a unique approach to sorting.

### Key Points:

**Two-Stack Sorting**: Participants are tasked with implementing a sorting algorithm that uses two stacks, commonly referred to as Stack A and Stack B. The goal is to arrange a set of integers in ascending order using specific operations on the stacks.

**Limited Set of Operations**: The algorithm is constrained to a limited set of operations, such as pushing and popping elements from the stacks, as well as rotating and swapping elements. Participants must design an effective sorting strategy using these operations.

**Optimization Challenges**: The project encourages optimization efforts to minimize the number of operations required to sort the integers efficiently. Participants may explore various sorting techniques and strategies to achieve optimal results.

**Visual Representation**: Some versions of the project may include a visualizer, allowing participants to observe the step-by-step execution of their sorting algorithm. Visualization aids in understanding the algorithm's behavior.

**Error Handling**: Robust error handling is essential, with participants accounting for potential issues such as invalid input or runtime errors.

### Methodology:
Participants follow a systematic approach, designing and implementing a sorting algorithm that efficiently uses the two stacks. Optimization efforts may involve finding patterns in the input set, minimizing the number of operations, and streamlining the sorting process.

### Assessment:
Evaluation is based on the efficiency and correctness of the sorting algorithm, adherence to project specifications, and optimization efforts. Attention to edge cases, error handling, and the overall clarity of the code contribute to the assessment.

The "push_swap" project challenges participants to think creatively and algorithmically, offering a hands-on opportunity to design an efficient sorting solution using stacks. It emphasizes optimization and strategic thinking, providing valuable insights into algorithm design and implementation.
